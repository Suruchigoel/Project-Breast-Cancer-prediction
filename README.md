The second major cause of women's death is breast cancer (after lung cancer). 246,660 of women's new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the US during 2016 and 40,450 of women’s death is estimated. 
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. 
Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. 
Breast cancer cells usually form a tumour that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. 
Breast cancer can spread when the cancer cells get into the blood or lymph system and are carried to other parts of the body. 
The cause of Breast Cancer includes changes and mutations in DNA. 
There are many different types of breast cancer and common ones include ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma.
Others, like phyllodes tumours and angiosarcoma are less common.
There are many algorithms for classification of breast cancer outcomes. 
The side effects of Breast Cancer are – Fatigue, Headaches, Pain and numbness (peripheral neuropathy), Bone loss and osteoporosis. 
There are many algorithms for classification and prediction of breast cancer outcomes.
The present paper gives a comparison between the performance of four classifiers: 
SVM , Logistic Regression , Random Forest and kNN which are among the most influential data mining algorithms.
